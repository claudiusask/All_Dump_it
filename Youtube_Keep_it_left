How to keep YouTube to extreme left while following the code.

I had this issue where the screen real-estate was not properly used for students. Whenever I am following a code tutorials, the left margin of the 
playing-window is leaving a lot of margin. So what I did is added an extension Stylebot from chrome extension store and added a custom CSS.

So what you have to do is go to options in this extension and add a new style sheet. Enter the URL (for me it was https://www.youtube.com) and I 
added a class of .style-scope {margin-left: 0px;}. That’s it, when in youtube TAB just enable or disable and enjoy at least an extra inch of real-estate and follow along the code tutorials 
with come more VS-Code - sublimeText – or any other IDE screen estate.

```
.style-scope {
 margin-left:0px
 }
```
